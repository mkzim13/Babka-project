# Babka Recipe Website — Project Narrative

## Instructional Problem

The goal of this project was to create a clear, beginner‑friendly recipe for cinnamon babka — a complex sweet bread that can be challenging for novice bakers. The instructional challenge was to break down a multi‑step, technique‑heavy process into approachable, well‑structured guidance that users could follow successfully without prior experience.

## Constraints

This project was completed over eight weeks with approximately five hours per week available for development and testing. Several constraints shaped the final deliverable:

- **Limited access to test users:** Only a small number of novice bakers were available, and I could not observe them in real time. All feedback was collected asynchronously after they attempted the recipe.
- **Tool limitations:** I chose Canva to build the recipe website due to its accessibility and cost. Canva was new to me, and its feature set influenced the design and structure of the final product.
- **Media constraints:** Time and skill limitations affected the quality and quantity of images. Video content, which would have clarified kneading and shaping techniques, was not feasible within the project timeline.

These constraints required careful prioritization of instructional clarity, layout, and usability.

## Planned vs. Actual Execution

At a high level, the project aligned with my initial plan: I produced a recipe website that was readable on both desktop and mobile devices, used clear information chunking, and incorporated supportive visuals. However, several aspects evolved during development.

### Use of Graphics

My goal was to use images to support — not replace — instructional text. Test users reported that the number and placement of images were helpful without being overwhelming. Placing images adjacent to the relevant steps allowed users to make connections without explicit cross‑referencing.

Testers suggested adding videos for complex techniques, but this was outside the project scope. Static images were used instead.

### Organization and Introductory Content

I included a brief introduction to explain what babka is and to motivate novice bakers. Although I personally prefer to skip introductions when using recipe sites, I recognized that beginners may benefit from context and reassurance. Feedback indicated that the introduction was appreciated, though its necessity remains ambiguous.

Canva’s built‑in navigation bar helped users bypass the introduction if desired, functioning similarly to a “Jump to Recipe” feature.

### Tool Limitations (Canva)

Several design decisions were influenced by Canva’s constraints:

- **Single‑page layout:** Canva assembles websites as a continuous scroll rather than separate pages. I adapted by using clear sectioning and navigation links.
- **Mobile responsiveness:** Elements such as columns and numbered lists displayed well on desktop but not on mobile. I redesigned these sections to ensure acceptable readability across devices.
- **Lack of interactive features:** Canva does not support hover‑based tooltips or pop‑ups. To provide supplemental explanations, I added a “Notes” section at the end of the recipe, though this required users to scroll back and forth.

These limitations highlighted the importance of testing across devices and understanding the capabilities of the chosen tool.

## Role of the Test Audience

Feedback from novice bakers significantly shaped the final version. Despite my culinary background, I initially underestimated how much explanation beginners would need. Testers identified unclear terminology, missing steps, and assumptions about prior knowledge.

Key takeaways:

- **Audience assumptions must be validated, not guessed.**
- **Too much detail can overwhelm; too little can confuse.**
- **Usability testing is essential, even for seemingly simple instructional content.**

Balancing completeness with clarity required iterative refinement and careful judgment about what level of detail was appropriate.

## Reflection

This project reinforced several core principles of technical and instructional writing:

- Tools shape deliverables; understanding their limitations is part of the design process.
- Real users reveal gaps that subject‑matter expertise can obscure.
- Effective instructional content requires empathy, iteration, and a willingness to revise assumptions.

Although the subject matter was culinary rather than technical, the underlying skills — structuring information, anticipating user needs, testing for usability, and adapting to constraints — directly translate to professional technical writing.
